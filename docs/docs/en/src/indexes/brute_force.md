# BruteForce

BruteForce is VSAG's **exact, flat** index. At query time it scores the query against every
vector in the corpus and returns the true top-k — no graph traversal, no inverted lists, no
approximation. Its main role is to be the **ground-truth baseline** that approximate indexes
(HGraph, IVF, …) are evaluated against, but it is also a reasonable production choice for small
corpora or for workloads where 100% recall is mandatory.

## How it works

1. **Build.** Vectors are stored in a single flat data cell encoded by `base_quantization_type`
   (default `fp32` — i.e. raw). No graph, no clustering, no training is performed for the
   uncompressed quantizers; PQ/SQ-style quantizers that require training will still run their
   training pass when used.
2. **Add.** New vectors are appended to the flat store. There is no rebalancing or rebuild cost.
3. **Search.** For each query the distance is computed against every stored vector under the
   configured `metric_type` (`l2`, `ip`, or `cosine`), then a top-k heap returns the closest
   ids. Search uses SIMD kernels and supports **intra-query parallelism** — a single query can
   be split across multiple threads via the `parallelism` search parameter (see
   `BruteForce::SearchWithRequest` in `src/algorithm/brute_force.cpp`).

Because the index keeps every vector verbatim (modulo the chosen quantizer), the result is
**exact** when `base_quantization_type` is `fp32` and is the standard reference used to compute
ground truth in the `eval_performance` tool.

## Quick start

```cpp
#include <vsag/vsag.h>

std::string params = R"({
    "dtype": "float32",
    "metric_type": "l2",
    "dim": 128
})";
auto index = vsag::Factory::CreateIndex("brute_force", params).value();

// Build.
auto base = vsag::Dataset::Make();
base->NumElements(n)->Dim(128)->Ids(ids)->Float32Vectors(data)->Owner(false);
index->Build(base);

// Search — no index-specific knobs; pass an empty JSON object (or set `parallelism`).
auto query = vsag::Dataset::Make();
query->NumElements(1)->Dim(128)->Float32Vectors(q)->Owner(false);
auto result = index->KnnSearch(query, /*topk=*/10, "{}").value();
```

A full runnable program is at
[`examples/cpp/105_index_brute_force.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/105_index_brute_force.cpp).

## Build parameters

The minimal config consists of the three top-level fields (`dtype`, `metric_type`, `dim`).
For most uses no `index_param` is needed — that is the form shown in
[example 105](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/105_index_brute_force.cpp).
Advanced users can pass an `index_param` object to enable quantization or storage tweaks:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `base_quantization_type` | string | `"fp32"` | `fp32`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `sq8`, `sq4`, `sq8_uniform`, `sq4_uniform`, `pq`, `pqfs`, `rabitq` — see the [Quantization chapter](../quantization/README.md) for per-quantizer details |
| `use_attribute_filter` | bool | `false` | Enable attribute-based filtering (see [Attribute Filter](../advanced/attribute_filter.md)) |

> **Note on `store_raw_vector`.** The `store_raw_vector` flag is parsed by the shared
> `InnerIndexParameter` but BruteForce does **not** consult it when deciding whether
> `GetRawVectorByIds` is available. On BruteForce, raw-vector retrieval is enabled strictly
> when `base_quantization_type` is `fp32` and either the metric is not `cosine` or the
> quantizer is configured to hold the per-vector norms (`hold_molds`). Setting
> `store_raw_vector: true` on BruteForce currently has no observable effect on the
> capability flags — use HGraph or IVF if you need a quantized index that still answers
> `GetRawVectorByIds`.

Example with `sq8` quantization for memory savings while keeping linear scan semantics:

```json
{
    "dtype": "float32",
    "metric_type": "ip",
    "dim": 128,
    "index_param": {
        "base_quantization_type": "sq8"
    }
}
```

When `base_quantization_type` is set to a quantizer that requires training (`sq8`,
`sq8_uniform`, `sq4_uniform`, `pq`, `pqfs`, `rabitq`), `Build` will run the training pass on
the supplied dataset before adding vectors; the resulting recall is no longer 100%. Only
`fp32`, `fp16`, and `bf16` skip training and preserve exact distances (modulo numeric
precision).

## Search parameters

BruteForce does not expose any index-specific search knobs (no `ef`, `nprobe`, etc.), but the
generic `IndexSearchParameter` fields are honored:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `parallelism` | int | `1` | Split the linear scan of a single query across this many threads in the index's internal thread pool. It applies to both `KnnSearch` and `RangeSearch`. Larger values cut single-query latency on large corpora at the cost of using more cores. Values `<= 0` are clamped to `1`. |

```cpp
// Single-threaded scan (default).
auto r1 = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, "{}").value();

// Use 8 threads to scan a single query in parallel.
auto r2 = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, R"({"parallelism": 8})").value();

// RangeSearch uses the same parallelism parameter.
auto r3 = index->RangeSearch(query, radius, R"({"parallelism": 8})").value();
```

For range search semantics, see [Range Search](../advanced/range_search.md).

## Capabilities

BruteForce advertises the following capability flags (see `BruteForce::InitFeatures` in
`src/algorithm/brute_force.cpp`):

| Capability                          | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| `SUPPORT_BUILD` / `SUPPORT_ADD_AFTER_BUILD` / `SUPPORT_ADD_CONCURRENT` | Build once, append later, concurrent inserts. |
| `SUPPORT_ADD_FROM_EMPTY` | Available with non-training quantizers (`fp32`, `fp16`, `bf16`). |
| `SUPPORT_KNN_SEARCH` / `SUPPORT_KNN_SEARCH_WITH_ID_FILTER` / `SUPPORT_SEARCH_CONCURRENT` | Standard top-k API and id-list filters, with concurrent search. |
| `SUPPORT_RANGE_SEARCH` / `SUPPORT_RANGE_SEARCH_WITH_ID_FILTER` | Available with non-training quantizers (`fp32`, `fp16`, `bf16`). |
| `SUPPORT_DELETE_BY_ID` / `SUPPORT_DELETE_CONCURRENT` | `Remove` by id is supported and concurrency-safe. |
| `SUPPORT_CAL_DISTANCE_BY_ID` | Distance lookup against stored vectors (non-training quantizers only). |
| `SUPPORT_GET_RAW_VECTOR_BY_IDS` | Available only when `base_quantization_type` is `fp32` and either the metric is not `cosine` or the underlying quantizer holds molds (`hold_molds`). Quantized BruteForce indexes do **not** advertise this flag. |
| `SUPPORT_CHECK_ID_EXIST` / `SUPPORT_CLONE` / `SUPPORT_ESTIMATE_MEMORY` / `SUPPORT_GET_MEMORY_USAGE` | Standard introspection and lifecycle. |
| `SUPPORT_SERIALIZE_BINARY_SET` / `SUPPORT_SERIALIZE_FILE` / `SUPPORT_SERIALIZE_WRITE_FUNC` | Full save surface. |
| `SUPPORT_DESERIALIZE_BINARY_SET` / `SUPPORT_DESERIALIZE_FILE` / `SUPPORT_DESERIALIZE_READER_SET` | Full load surface. (There is no `DESERIALIZE_WRITE_FUNC` counterpart — read paths use `READER_SET` instead.) |
| `NEED_TRAIN` | Set when `base_quantization_type` is one of `sq8`, `sq4`, `sq8_uniform`, `sq4_uniform`, `pq`, `pqfs`, `rabitq`. |

Notably **not** supported by BruteForce: `SUPPORT_UPDATE_VECTOR_CONCURRENT`,
`SUPPORT_UPDATE_ID_CONCURRENT`, and `SUPPORT_EXPORT_MODEL`.

## When to use BruteForce

- **Recall baseline.** Compute the ground truth that approximate indexes are scored against
  (this is what the `eval_performance` tool does).
- **Tiny corpora.** A few hundred to a few hundred thousand vectors, where the cost of a full
  scan is acceptable and you want to skip tuning altogether.
- **Strict-recall requirements.** Use cases that cannot tolerate any approximation error.
- **Quantization experiments at small scale.** Reuse the same scan pipeline but compare
  different `base_quantization_type` settings without the confounding effect of a graph or
  inverted-list structure.

For anything larger, prefer [HGraph](hgraph.md) (latency-sensitive, high recall) or
[IVF](ivf.md) (throughput-oriented, memory-friendly).
