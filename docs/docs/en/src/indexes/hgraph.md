# HGraph

HGraph is VSAG's flagship **graph-based** index. It builds a hierarchical proximity graph
and offers a rich set of quantization options, a unified
build-parameter schema (`index_param`), and first-class support for reordering,
incremental updates, deletion, and ELP-based runtime tuning.

For most dense-vector workloads (text / image / multimodal embeddings, 64–4096 dims,
from a few thousand up to hundreds of millions of points), HGraph is the recommended
default.

- Source: `src/algorithm/hgraph.{h,cpp}`
- Example: [`examples/cpp/103_index_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/103_index_hgraph.cpp)

## How it works

1. **Graph construction.** Vectors are organised in a layered proximity graph; upper
   layers act as navigation aids, the bottom layer connects every data point to its
   nearest neighbours within a `max_degree` budget. The construction algorithm can be
   NSW-style insertion (`graph_type: "nsw"`, the default), ODescent
   (`graph_type: "odescent"`), or PiPNN (`graph_type: "pipnn"`).
2. **Quantization.** The base storage is compressed with a configurable quantizer
   (`base_quantization_type` — `fp32`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `sq8`, `sq8_per_vector` (L2), `sq4`, `sq8_uniform`, `sq4_uniform`,
   `pq`, `pqfs`, `rabitq`, `tq`). Optionally, a second high-precision copy is kept
   (`use_reorder: true` with `precise_quantization_type`) and used to re-rank the
   candidates returned by the coarse search.
3. **Search.** Greedy beam search traverses the graph top-down, expanding the current
   frontier up to `ef_search` candidates. When reordering is enabled, the final list is
   re-scored against the precise representation.

## Quick start

```cpp
#include <vsag/vsag.h>

std::string params = R"({
    "dtype": "float32",
    "metric_type": "l2",
    "dim": 128,
    "index_param": {
        "base_quantization_type": "sq8",
        "max_degree": 32,
        "ef_construction": 400
    }
})";
auto index = vsag::Factory::CreateIndex("hgraph", params).value();

// Build.
auto base = vsag::Dataset::Make();
base->NumElements(n)->Dim(128)->Ids(ids)->Float32Vectors(data)->Owner(false);
index->Build(base);

// Search.
auto query = vsag::Dataset::Make();
query->NumElements(1)->Dim(128)->Float32Vectors(q)->Owner(false);
auto result = index->KnnSearch(
    query, /*topk=*/10, R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 100}})").value();
```

## Build parameters

Build-time parameters live under `index_param`. The table below highlights the keys
most users need; the exhaustive list is in [Index Parameters](../resources/index_parameters.md).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `base_quantization_type` | string | — (required) | `fp32`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `sq8`, `sq8_per_vector` (L2), `sq4`, `sq8_uniform`, `sq4_uniform`, `pq`, `pqfs`, `rabitq`, `tq` — see the [Quantization chapter](../quantization/) for per-quantizer details |
| `max_degree` | int | `64` | Maximum out-degree per graph node |
| `ef_construction` | int | `400` | Candidate list size during build (higher = better recall, slower build) |
| `alpha` | float | `1.0` | Final robust-pruning factor; PiPNN requires a finite value at least `1.0`. |
| `graph_type` | string | `"nsw"` | Graph algorithm: `nsw`, `odescent`, or `pipnn` |
| `pipnn_max_leaf_size` | int | `1024` | Maximum partition leaf size. Larger leaves increase candidate coverage and leaf distance work. |
| `pipnn_min_leaf_size` | int | `64` | Target used when merging undersized leaves. |
| `pipnn_leader_sample_rate` | float | `0.005` | Fraction sampled as partition leaders; each partition uses at least `2` and at most `1000` leaders, bounded by its point count. |
| `pipnn_fanout` | int[] | `[10, 2]` | Number of nearest leader partitions joined at each listed partition level; deeper levels use `1`. |
| `pipnn_leaf_neighbor_count` | int | `5` | Nearest candidates contributed per point in each leaf. This is the primary PiPNN quality/build-work knob; leaves smaller than `pipnn_min_leaf_size` use at least `4`. |
| `pipnn_hash_plane_count` | int | `12` | Direction-hash bits, in `[1, 15]`; `max_degree <= 2^pipnn_hash_plane_count`. |
| `pipnn_reservoir_size` | int | `64` | Candidate slots retained per point before final pruning; effective capacity is at least `max_degree`. |
| `use_reverse_edges` | bool | `false` | Track incoming neighbors for O(1) reverse-edge lookup. Roughly doubles edge storage and is unsupported with `graph_storage_type: "compressed"`. |
| `label_remap_type` | string | `"pg"` | Label-to-inner-ID map implementation: `"pg"` or `"robin"`. Keep the same value when restoring or combining compatible indexes. |
| `use_reorder` | bool | `false` | Keep a high-precision copy and re-rank after the coarse search |
| `reorder_source` | string | `"precise"` | Reorder from `"precise"` codes or directly from `"base"` codes. RaBitQ x+y split, including `tq_chain: "mrle, rabitq"`, sets `"base"` automatically. |
| `precise_quantization_type` | string | `"fp32"` | Quantizer used for reordering (takes effect only with `use_reorder: true`) |
| `base_pq_dim` | int | `1` | Number of PQ subspaces. When using `pq` / `pqfs`, set this explicitly instead of relying on the default. |
| `mrle_dim` | int | `0` | Output dimension for an MRLE transform in `tq_chain`; allowed range `[0, dim]`, where `0` means the input dimension. |
| `fast_encode_rabitq` | bool | `true` | Use the fast multi-bit RaBitQ encoder; set to `false` for the previous exact encoder. |
| `fast_encode_rabitq_rounds` | int | `6` | Fast RaBitQ coordinate-refinement rounds, in `[1, 32]`. |
| `rabitq_fused_datacell` | bool | `false` | Fuse the bottom HGraph node and RaBitQ split codes into one in-memory record. Requires L2/IP, flat in-memory graph storage, RaBitQ x+y split codes with x in `[1, 4]`, and the other constraints described in [RaBitQ x+y split](../quantization/rabitq_split.md). |
| `train_sample_count` | int | `65536` | Maximum number of vectors sampled for quantizer training; must be at least `512` when set explicitly. |
| `build_thread_count` | int | `100` | Threads used to parallelise build |
| `support_duplicate` | bool | `false` | Enable duplicate-ID detection on insert |
| `deduplicate_storage` | bool | `false` | Share vector storage between duplicates; requires `support_duplicate: true` |
| `duplicate_distance_threshold` | float | `0.0` | Duplicate-detection distance threshold. When greater than `0`, deduplicate by the nearest candidate distance; when `0`, fall back to the current code `memcmp` check |
| `support_remove` | bool | `false` | Enable graph delete-tracking metadata used by mark-remove recovery paths |
| `support_force_remove` | bool | `false` | Enable `RemoveMode::FORCE_REMOVE` and its extra synchronization on the built index |
| `store_raw_vector` | bool | `false` | Keep the raw vector in addition to the quantized copy (useful for `cosine`) |
| `use_elp_optimizer` | bool | `false` | Auto-tune search parameters after build |
| `base_io_type` / `precise_io_type` | string | `"block_memory_io"` | Storage backend (`memory_io`, `block_memory_io`, `buffer_io`, `async_io`, `uring_io`, `mmap_io`) |
| `base_file_path` / `precise_file_path` | string | — | File path; required when the corresponding `*_io_type` is disk-backed (`buffer_io`, `async_io`, `uring_io`, `mmap_io`) |
| `base_direct_read` / `precise_direct_read` | bool | `false` | With `uring_io`, open the corresponding file using direct IO instead of the page cache. |
| `hgraph_init_capacity` | int | `100` | Initial capacity hint (doesn't cap the final size) |
| `persist_source_id` | bool | `false` | Persist source-ID metadata during serialization so a restored index can later export a reusable build cache. |
| `use_conjugate_graph` | bool | `false` | Enable `Feedback`/`Pretrain` graph enhancement; see [Graph Index Enhancement](../advanced/enhance_graph.md). |
| `resize_increase_count_bit` | int | `10` | `log2` of the slot-growth batch. Valid range is `1` to `31`; `1` grows in 2-slot batches and `10` in 1,024-slot batches. Smaller values reduce preallocation but can increase reallocations. |

`use_reverse_edges` is intended for workloads that need fast incoming-neighbor inspection, graph
analysis, or future graph-maintenance algorithms. It is disabled by default because maintaining
the reverse adjacency approximately doubles edge storage.

`label_remap_type` changes the internal label map, not user-visible IDs. `"pg"` is the default;
`"robin"` selects the alternate robin-map implementation. Benchmark the target ID distribution
before changing it.

### PiPNN build boundary

Set `graph_type: "pipnn"` to use [PiPNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21247) for the initial,
full `Build`. The PiPNN builder accepts dense `float32` input with `metric_type` set to `"l2"`,
`"ip"`, or `"cosine"`. It builds the bottom graph from the original build vectors, then reuses
HGraph's route layers, storage, search, filtering, reordering, incremental `Add`, removal, and
serialization paths. The persistent base storage may use a supported quantizer such as `sq8`,
including RaBitQ with SQ8 reorder. Cache-assisted build and deduplicated vector storage are not
supported with PiPNN. The `pipnn_*` parameters in the table above tune this builder;
`ef_construction` does not. The existing `alpha` parameter controls PiPNN's final robust pruning.

`build_thread_count` parallelizes vector preparation, partitioning, candidate generation, and
final pruning. Keep `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` when benchmarking so BLAS threads do not obscure
builder scaling. The reproducible `tools/eval/pipnn_parallel.yaml` workload compares NSW,
ODescent, and PiPNN at a matched Recall@10 target on SIFT1M and query-validates every graph.

### Deduplicating vector storage

Set both `support_duplicate: true` and `deduplicate_storage: true` to let duplicate
vectors share one physical code slot while retaining their individual labels. This option
currently supports only dense-vector HGraph indexes using `graph_type: "nsw"`; it is not
available for `graph_type: "odescent"` or `graph_type: "pipnn"`.

The following operations and configurations are not supported while storage deduplication
is enabled:

- force removal (`support_force_remove: true`);
- cache-assisted build after `ImportCache()`;
- `Merge`;
- legacy v0.14 serialization.

`UpdateVector` is supported only for IDs whose vector storage is not shared with another
duplicate-group member.

Current serialization and streaming serialization are supported.

## Supported input data types

The `dtype` field in the top-level build config selects how `Dataset` interprets the raw vector
bytes. HGraph supports four input types; the `dtype` value, the corresponding `Dataset` setter,
and the example demonstrating each combination are summarised below.

| `dtype`     | Element type | `Dataset` setter         | Example                                                                                                |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `float32`   | `float`      | `Float32Vectors`         | [`103_index_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/103_index_hgraph.cpp) |
| `int8`      | `int8_t`     | `Int8Vectors`            | [`316_index_int8_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/316_index_int8_hgraph.cpp) |
| `float16`   | `uint16_t` (IEEE 754 binary16, bit-pattern packed) | `Float16Vectors` | [`321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp) |
| `bfloat16`  | `uint16_t` (Brain Float, bit-pattern packed) | `Float16Vectors` (shared with FP16) | adapt `321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp` per the notes below                                                  |

The `dim` value is the logical vector dimensionality (number of elements), not the byte length, so
the same `dim` is reused across all four data types.

### `int8` input

Quantized `int8` vectors are passed directly via `Int8Vectors`:

```cpp
std::vector<int8_t> data(num_vectors * dim);  // populate with int8 elements
auto base = vsag::Dataset::Make();
base->NumElements(num_vectors)->Dim(dim)->Ids(ids)
    ->Int8Vectors(data.data())->Owner(false);
```

Build config (note `dtype: "int8"`):

```json
{
    "dtype": "int8",
    "metric_type": "l2",
    "dim": 128,
    "index_param": {
        "base_quantization_type": "pq",
        "max_degree": 26,
        "ef_construction": 100,
        "alpha": 1.2
    }
}
```

Queries use the same `Int8Vectors` setter and the same `dtype`. A runnable example is
[`316_index_int8_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/316_index_int8_hgraph.cpp).

### `float16` / `bfloat16` input

FP16 and BF16 vectors are both passed through `Float16Vectors`, which takes a `const uint16_t*`
that points at the 16-bit storage of each element. Conversion from `float` is up to the caller;
inside the VSAG source tree there are convenience helpers (`vsag::generic::FloatToFP16` in
[`src/simd/fp16_simd.h`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/src/simd/fp16_simd.h)
and `vsag::generic::FloatToBF16` in
[`src/simd/bf16_simd.h`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/src/simd/bf16_simd.h)),
but these are **internal headers** that are not installed under `include/vsag/`. Application code
linking against an installed VSAG library should provide its own conversion (for example, copy
the small helper, use `_cvtss_sh` / F16C intrinsics, or any FP16 library of choice). The snippet
below uses the in-tree helper for brevity:

```cpp
// The fp16/bf16 helpers below live in src/simd/ and are not part of the public
// installed headers. Replace with your own float -> uint16_t conversion when
// linking against an installed VSAG.
#include "simd/fp16_simd.h"  // FloatToFP16 (for BF16, use simd/bf16_simd.h / FloatToBF16)

std::vector<uint16_t> data(num_vectors * dim);
for (size_t i = 0; i < data.size(); ++i) {
    data[i] = vsag::generic::FloatToFP16(some_float_source());
}
auto base = vsag::Dataset::Make();
base->NumElements(num_vectors)->Dim(dim)->Ids(ids)
    ->Float16Vectors(data.data())->Owner(false);
```

Build config:

```json
{
    "dtype": "float16",
    "metric_type": "l2",
    "dim": 128,
    "index_param": {
        "base_quantization_type": "pq",
        "max_degree": 26,
        "ef_construction": 100,
        "alpha": 1.2
    }
}
```

To switch the example to BF16, change `dtype` to `"bfloat16"` and replace `FloatToFP16` with
`FloatToBF16`; the `Float16Vectors` setter and the rest of the build/search flow stay the same.
A runnable FP16 example is
[`321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp).

> **Note.** The header comment at the top of `321_index_fp16_hgraph.cpp` currently mentions a
> `BFloat16Vectors()` setter, but no such setter exists — `Float16Vectors` is the single entry
> point for both FP16 and BF16. Use it for both `dtype: "float16"` and `dtype: "bfloat16"`.

### Choosing an input type

- Pick `float32` when accuracy matters most and memory budget allows; this is the default.
- Pick `float16` / `bfloat16` to halve the input storage. FP16 has a smaller exponent range; BF16
  has fewer mantissa bits but the same exponent range as FP32, which is often preferable for
  embedding-style vectors.
- Pick `int8` when your data is already integer-quantised (e.g. produced by an upstream quantiser
  or by a model with int8 outputs). With `int8` input you typically still combine a coarse
  quantizer such as `pq` / `sq8` for the in-index storage.

The chosen `dtype` only constrains the **input** representation. The on-disk / in-memory storage is
still controlled by `base_quantization_type` (and optionally `precise_quantization_type` when
`use_reorder: true`), so e.g. `dtype: "float16"` + `base_quantization_type: "sq8"` is valid.

## Search parameters

Search-time parameters live under the `hgraph` sub-object:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ef_search` | int64 | — (required) | Positive search-frontier size. Any value up to `INT64_MAX` is accepted; there is no `topk`-relative upper bound. Larger values increase recall, latency, and frontier memory. |
| `hops_limit` | int | unlimited | Hard cap on the number of hops the beam search performs before returning the current frontier. |
| `skip_ratio` | float | `0.2` | Performance tuning parameter for filtered search. Controls the ratio of invalid points to skip, in range `[0.0, 1.0]`. `skip_ratio=0.2` means skip 20% of invalid points and only check 80%. Higher values improve performance but may reduce recall. Only applies to searches with filters. See [Filter Skip Strategy](#filter-skip-strategy-skip_ratio-and-skip_strategy) below. |
| `skip_strategy` | string | `"deterministic_accumulative"` | Strategy for filter skipping. Options: `"random"` (random skipping) or `"deterministic_accumulative"` (deterministic cumulative skipping). See [Filter Skip Strategy](#filter-skip-strategy-skip_ratio-and-skip_strategy) below. |
| `brute_force_threshold` | float | `0.0` | Selectivity-aware brute-force fallback. When `> 0` and the supplied filter's `ValidRatio()` is `≤ brute_force_threshold`, the search **bypasses the graph traversal entirely** and runs an exact scan over the valid ids using the best available flatten codes (see the section below). Must lie in `[0.0, 1.0]`; the default `0.0` disables the feature and preserves legacy behavior. |
| `rabitq_one_bit_search` | bool | `false` | Enables the RaBitQ filter/lower-bound path. On an x+y split index it uses all x filter bits; see [RaBitQ x+y Split](../quantization/rabitq_split.md). |
| `rabitq_error_rate` | float | index default | Positive lower-bound error multiplier for this search. It can be tuned without rebuilding the split index. |

```cpp
auto result = index->KnnSearch(
    query, topk, R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 200}})").value();
```

### Brute-force fallback under highly selective filters (`brute_force_threshold`)

Graph traversal is the right strategy when most candidates pass the filter — the
graph quickly reaches the neighborhood of the query. As filter selectivity
increases (only a tiny fraction of vectors survive), the beam has to expand far
more nodes just to fill `ef_search` with **valid** candidates, and recall drops.
At some point an exhaustive scan over the surviving ids is both faster *and*
exact.

`brute_force_threshold` lets HGraph make that switch automatically on a
per-query basis:

```cpp
// When the active filter keeps ≤ 1% of ids, run an exact scan instead.
auto params = R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 200, "brute_force_threshold": 0.01}})";
auto result = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, params, my_filter).value();
```

How it works (`src/algorithm/hgraph/hgraph_search.cpp`):

- The fallback only fires when **all** of the following hold:
    - `brute_force_threshold > 0.0`, **and**
    - a filter is supplied, **and**
    - `filter->ValidRatio() <= brute_force_threshold`.
- The accuracy of `Filter::ValidRatio()` matters — it is the user-supplied hint
  the dispatcher checks against the threshold. See
  [Filtered Search](../advanced/filtered_search.md) for the API contract.
- The scan iterates every valid inner id and computes distances in batches of
  64 using the most precise flatten storage available (raw vectors if
  `store_raw_vector` was set, otherwise the high-precision reorder codes when
  `use_reorder=true`, otherwise the base quantized codes).
- Because the scan already uses precise codes when present, the post-search
  reorder pass is **skipped** for queries that took the brute-force branch.
- Applies to `KnnSearch` (the non-iterator overload, which is what
  `SearchWithRequest` and the standard `KnnSearch(query, k, params, filter)`
  call) and to `RangeSearch`. It does **not** apply to the iterator-style
  `KnnSearch(..., IteratorContext*&, ...)`, because a single sweep cannot be
  paged across multiple iterator calls.

Picking a value:

- Leave at `0.0` (default) for unfiltered or weakly filtered workloads.
- For highly selective filters, `0.01–0.05` is a reasonable starting point.
  Setting it higher than that effectively turns the index into a brute-force
  scanner whenever a filter is present.
- The cost of the brute-force scan is roughly `O(N × dim)` where `N` is the
  total number of indexed vectors (regardless of selectivity, because every id
  is visited to check `CheckValid`). The benefit grows when graph search would
  otherwise need a much larger `ef_search` to recover recall.

See
[`322_feature_hgraph_brute_force_threshold.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/322_feature_hgraph_brute_force_threshold.cpp)
for a runnable brute-force fallback example.

### Filter Skip Strategy (skip_ratio and skip_strategy)

When searching with a filter, HGraph needs to frequently call Filter::CheckValid() during graph traversal to verify whether each candidate point is valid. This check can be expensive (especially for complex filter logic). skip_ratio and skip_strategy provide a probabilistic optimization: they skip some filter checks to speed up the search, but may reduce recall.

#### How It Works

This is a probabilistic optimization strategy: we don't know in advance which points are valid, so we decide probabilistically whether to visit each point.

- skip_ratio (default 0.2): Controls the aggressiveness of skipping filter checks. skip_ratio=0.2 means skip 20% of candidate checks and only check 80%. Higher values skip more, making search faster but potentially reducing recall.
- skip_strategy (default "deterministic_accumulative"): Determines how skipping is distributed:
  - "random": Random skipping. Each point is visited independently with probability `visit_ratio = valid_ratio + (1 - valid_ratio) * (1 - skip_ratio)`, so roughly a `1 - skip_ratio` fraction of invalid points are skipped.
  - "deterministic_accumulative": Deterministic cumulative skipping. Emits visit decisions at fixed intervals so that the long-run visit ratio matches the target `visit_ratio`, with lower variance than the random strategy.

The specific formula:
- Let valid_ratio be the filter's global validity rate (from Filter::ValidRatio())
- Probability of visiting each point = valid_ratio + (1 - valid_ratio) * (1 - skip_ratio)
- In expectation, this targets skipping about skip_ratio of invalid candidate checks when Filter::ValidRatio() is accurate

#### Usage Examples

```cpp
// Conservative setting: skip 10% of invalid candidate checks, suitable for high-recall
// scenarios where latency is less critical
auto params = R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 200, "skip_ratio": 0.1}})";
auto result = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, params, my_filter).value();

// Use random strategy
auto params = R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 200, "skip_ratio": 0.2, "skip_strategy": "random"}})";
auto result = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, params, my_filter).value();

// Aggressive skipping: skip 50% of invalid candidate checks for lower latency
auto params = R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 200, "skip_ratio": 0.5}})";
auto result = index->KnnSearch(query, topk, params, my_filter).value();
```

#### Choosing Values

- Default 0.2: Suitable for most scenarios, balancing performance and recall.
- 0.1 or lower: Conservative setting, suitable for scenarios with high recall requirements where latency is less critical.
- 0.5 or higher: Aggressive skipping, suitable for latency-sensitive scenarios where recall degradation is acceptable (e.g., real-time recommendation systems).
- 0.0: Don't skip any points, equivalent to disabling this optimization (all points will be checked).

Important notes:
- Only applies to searches with filters. These parameters are ignored when no filter is present.
- Performance optimization works better when Filter::ValidRatio() is accurately estimated.
- Can be used together with brute_force_threshold: when the filter is very strict (ValidRatio is very small), brute_force_threshold will trigger brute-force fallback; otherwise, graph traversal + skip optimization is used.

## When to use HGraph

- Dense float vectors with dimensions roughly between 64 and 4096.
- Latency-sensitive queries where high recall matters.
- Mixed workloads with incremental insertion (optionally force removal via `support_force_remove`).
- Memory-constrained deployments that benefit from `sq8` / `sq4_uniform` / `pq` — often
  in combination with `use_reorder` to recover recall.

For repeated daily or snapshot builds with stable source identifiers, see
[HGraph Build Cache](../advanced/build_cache.md). It documents `Dataset::SourceID`,
`ExportCache`/`ImportCache`, `persist_source_id`, and cache hit-rate diagnostics.

If your workload is partition-heavy (coarse-grained buckets scanned per query) or
strongly I/O-bound on a SSD, compare against [IVF](ivf.md) before committing to HGraph.
